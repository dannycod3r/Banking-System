* Get familiar using Git and GitHub as Software Engineer.
* Learn and Improve communication skills.
* Learn and Improve soft skill.
* Learn and Improve technical skill.
* Challenge ourselves to build a larger(as at the time of building) project on our own.

## Lessons from working on this project
While working on this project, these are few of the things we learn(will be updated as we progress)
* Researching a problem/bug in your code.
* Introducing and fixing bugs.
* Understanding that facing challenges as a Software Engineer is a must but overcoming it is the best
you will ever do for yourself and your company/team


## Testing
Your can test the app at your end too,(As at now) by cloning the repository locally and running it with python.
However, we plan to make it available for testing online as well as soon as possible.
